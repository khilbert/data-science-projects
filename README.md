# data-science-projects

Various small projects I've worked on to practice data science and machine learning techniques.

- Clustering investigates applications of k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering to tease out hidden relationships in Japanese economic and societal data. With economic data (GDP, consumer price index, foreign currency exchange rate, unemployment figures, inflation estimates, etc.) and societal data (fertility rates, life expectancies, etc.), can one identify different periods of Japan's history, i.e. pre-bubble economy, bubble economy, and post-bubble economy life simply using clustering methods?

- Simple logistic regression exercise to determine separation boundaries between wines deemed good/bad by an expert sommelier using various chemical properties (pH, alcohol, sugar, sulfates, acidity) of the wine as input features.

- Principal component analysis (PCA) with additional agglomerative clustering in order to try and group countries of the world into similar categories of development based on economic and social data (GDP,	life expectancy, and indices measuring generosity, corruption, freedom, and social support). The combination of these two techniques performs extremely well and is able to sort countries into very reasonable groupings that most economists/social scientists would likely agree with.
