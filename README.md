# data-science-projects

Various small projects I've worked on to practice data science techniques.

- Clustering investigates applications of k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering to tease out hidden relationships in Japanese economic and societal data. With economic data (total GDP, consumer price indices, foreign currency exchange rates, inflation figures, etc.) and societal data (fertility rates, life expectancies, etc.), can one identify different periods of Japan's history, i.e. pre-bubble economy, bubble economy, and post-bubble economy life?
