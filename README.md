# data-science-projects

Various small projects I've worked on to practice data science techniques.

- Clustering investigates applications of k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering to tease out hidden relationships in Japanese economic and societal data. With economic data (GDP, consumer price index, foreign currency exchange rate, unemployment figures, inflation estimates, etc.) and societal data (fertility rates, life expectancies, etc.), can one identify different periods of Japan's history, i.e. pre-bubble economy, bubble economy, and post-bubble economy life simply using clustering methods?

- Investigation of oil-field pump data with the aim of obtaining so-called 'pumpcards', i.e. plots of tension in pumping rods as a function of position from noisy, raw data of the pumping rod's acceleration and tension. Such cards are of importance to oilfield diagnostic companies eager to digitize existing pumps to provide live diagnostics that can increase pump efficiency, identify mechanical faults, and assess oil field conditions below the earth from above-ground data. In this project I worked with real industry data, applied cleaning techniques to disgard non-physical noise, and performed a series of numerical integration, avoiding inherent drift, to obtain the pumpcard which can they be analzed by an expert petroleum engineer.
