# data-science-projects

Various small projects I've worked on to practice data science techniques.

- Clustering investigates applications of k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering to tease out hidden relationships in Japanese economic and societal data. With economic data (GDP, consumer price index, foreign currency exchange rate, unemployment figures, inflation estimates, etc.) and societal data (fertility rates, life expectancies, etc.), can one identify different periods of Japan's history, i.e. pre-bubble economy, bubble economy, and post-bubble economy life simply using clustering methods?
